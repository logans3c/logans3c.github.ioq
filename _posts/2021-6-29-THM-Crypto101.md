title:  "THM Crypto101 Room"
description: It is an explanation of some basics of cryptography in light of the crypto 101 room (this article contains some resources and Arabic tips) 
tags: Tryhackme
---

## [Task 1] What will this room cover?

This room will cover:

    • Why cryptography matters for security and CTFs
    • The two main classes of cryptography and their uses
    • RSA, and some of the uses of RSA
    • 2 methods of Key Exchange
    • Notes about the future of encryption with the rise of Quantum Computing
    
## [Task 2] Key terms

#### #1 I agree not to complain too much about how theory heavy this room is :

ANSWER: No answer needed
    
#### #2 Are SSH keys protected with a passphrase or a password :
                        
ANSWER: passphrase  

Cause : Passphrase Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.

## [Task 3] Why is Encryption important?
    
#### #1 What does SSH stand for? :
     
ANSWER: Secure Shell  

Cause : What is [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell_Protocol)

#### #2 How do web servers prove their identity?

Answer : certificates  

Cause : When you connect to your bank, there’s a certificate that uses cryptography to prove that it is actually your bank rather than a hacker.

#### #3 What is the main set of standards you need to comply with if you store or process payment card details?

Answer : PCI-DSS  

Cause : Whenever sensitive user data needs to be stored, it should be encrypted. Standards like PCI-DSS state that the data should be encrypted both at rest (in storage) AND while being transmitted. If you’re handling payment card details, you need to comply with these PCI regulations.

## [Task 4] Crucial Crypto Maths

### Arabic Tip
#### كيف تجيب باقي القسمة رياضيا

مثال : 25 % 7

1# هنقسم 25 % 7

2# هنجيب أول عدد صحيح قبل 3,5 وهو 3 

3# ثم نضرب 3 في 7 لأن 7 هو المقسوم عليه في المسألة الأصلية .. أذن 3 * 7 = 21

4# نطرح 21 من المقسوم .. 25 - 21 = 4

5# أذن باقي القسمة = 4

#### #1 What’s 30 % 5?

Answer : 0  

Cause : 5*6 = 30 so it divides exactly with no remainder

#### #2 What’s 25 % 7

Answer : 4

Cause : You can watch this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg6CTCu8iio) to know  how to do modulo operation

#### #3 What’s 118613842 % 9091

Answer : 3565

Cause : you can do it using this [site](https://www.omnicalculator.com/math/modulo) or using this python code 
```python
a = 118613842 % 9091
print (a)
```
## [Task 5] Types of Encryption

#### #1 Should you trust DES? Yea/Nay

Answer : Nay

Cause : DES, the Data Encryption Standard, can no longer be considered secure. While no major flaws in its innards are known, it is fundamentally inadequate because its 56-bit key is too short. It is vulnerable to brute-force search of the whole key space, either by large collections of general-purpose machines or even more quickly by specialized hardware

#### #2 What was the result of the attempt to make DES more secure so that it could be used for longer?

Answer : Triple DES

Cause : You can read about Triple Des [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES)

#### #3 Is it ok to share your public key? Yea/Nay

Answer : Yea

Cause : You can share your public key with anyone who wants to communicate with you; it doesn't matter who sees it.

## [Task 6] RSA – Rivest Shamir Adleman

### Arabic resource 
ممكن تشوف الفيديو ده لتعرف كيف تعمل هذه الخوارزمية ... 

[الفيديو](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4_R_bysWAI&t=76s)

#### #1 p= 4391, q= 6659. What is n?

Answer : 29239669

Cause : 4391 * 6659 = 29239669 .. you can do it using this python code 
```python
a = 4391 * 6659
print (a)
```
#### #2 I understand enough about RSA to move on, and I know where to look to learn more if I want to.

ANSWER: No answer needed

## [Task 7] Establishing Keys Using Asymmetric Cryptography

#### #1 I understand how keys can be established using Public Key (asymmetric) cryptography.

ANSWER: No answer needed

## [Task 9] SSH Authentication

#### #1 I recommend giving this a go yourself. Deploy a VM, like Learn Linux and try to add an SSH key and log in with the private key.

Answer : No answer needed

#### #2 Download the SSH Private Key attached to this room.

Answer : No answer needed

#### #3 What algorithm does the key use?

Answer : RSA

How To know : These are two ways of how to do it

#### #4 Crack the password with John The Ripper and rockyou, what’s the passphrase for the key?

Answer : delicious

How to do that : 
```Bash
python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py file_location > /hash_location/hash_name
john /hash_location/hash_name --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
My operation :

## [Task 10] Explaining Diffie Hellman Key Exchange

#### #1 I understand how Diffie Hellman Key Exchange works at a basic level

ANSWER: No answer needed

## [Task 11]  PGP, GPG and AES

#### #1 Time to try some GPG. Download the archive attached and extract it somewhere sensible.

ANSWER: No answer needed

#### #2 You have the private key, and a file encrypted with the public key. Decrypt the file. What’s the secret word?

Answer : Pineapple

How to do that :
